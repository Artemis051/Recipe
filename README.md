Recipes can be sorted by categories (e.g., cuisine type, dietary preferences, meal type) to facilitate browsing.
4. Recipe Saving:
Users can save their favorite recipes to their profile for easy access later.
Saved recipes are organized within the user's profile, allowing them to build a personalized recipe collection.
5. Search and Filtering:
Users can search for specific recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or tags.
Filtering options allow users to narrow down their search results based on criteria such as dietary restrictions or cooking time.
6. Responsive Design:
The platform is designed to be accessible and user-friendly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Responsive design ensures a consistent user experience regardless of the screen size.
7. Integration with Stripe:
Integration with the Stripe payment platform allows users to make donations.
Donations can support the platform's maintenance or charitable causes, adding an extra layer of community engagement.

Users can access the platform even when they're offline, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
9. Comprehensive README:
The project includes a high-quality README file providing an overview of the platform, instructions for deployment, and links to relevant resources.
The README serves as a guide for developers and users interested in understanding and using the Recipe Sharing Platform.
10. UI Styling:
Styling using CSS-in-JS or a component library like Semantic UI ensures a polished and professional-looking user interface.
The platform's design reflects modern design principles and is visually appealing to users.
11. Security:
Measures are implemented to ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access.
User authentication, data validation, and protection of sensitive information are integral parts of the platform's architecture.
